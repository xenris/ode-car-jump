This is my simple experiment of ODE (Open Dynamics Engine), OpenGL, SDL, and the wavefront OBJ format.

Do whatever you like with it.

It's a hack of various different things that I've written so don't
expect it to be neat or for the commented out lines to mean anything.
Also, I am writing this readme at least 5 months after writing the code,
so I don't remember exactly what is in the code.

I take no responsibility for anything bad this code might do (i.e. Read
it before you run it), but I'll gladly take full responsibility for anything awesome that this code does. ;)

Controls:
    w, a, s, d, shift, space    = move
    mouse                       = look around
    e                           = move faster
    c                           = switch camera between being free and being fixed to the car
    g                           = run simulation, while pressed
    scroll up, scroll down      = speed up and slow down simulation
    esc                         = close
